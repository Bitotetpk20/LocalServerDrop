## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**
- **npm**

### Installation
1. Download the installer
2. Run as administrator (for proper installation)
3. Follow the setup wizard
4. Launch from Start Menu or desktop shortcut

### Running with Node.js runtime (No installation)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KristupasJon/LocalServerDrop.git
   cd LocalServerDrop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build CSS (required - output.css is not tracked in git)**
   ```bash
   npm run buildcss
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Development Mode

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This watches for changes in `main`, `renderer`, `preload`, and `backend` directories.

## 📦 Building for Distribution

Build for your current platform:
```bash
npm run build
```

Build for specific platforms:
```bash
npm run build:win    # Windows
npm run build:mac    # macOS
npm run build:linux  # Linux
```

Built applications will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## 🌐 Usage

### Desktop App
1. Launch LocalServerDrop
2. Drag and drop files onto the upload zone, or click to browse
3. Files are automatically uploaded to the local server
4. Use the "File Vault" section to manage uploaded files
5. Click the "localhost:3000" button to open the web interface

### Web Interface
1. Open any web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Upload and download files through the web interface
4. Perfect for sharing with other devices on your network

### Network Sharing
- Other devices on your network can access files by visiting `http://[YOUR-IP]:3000`
- Find your IP address using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Local Network Only**: Server binds to localhost by default
- **Admin Token Authentication**: File deletion requires admin token
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents unauthorized file access
- **Sandboxed Frontend**: Electron security best practices implemented

Additional notes:
- **Per-session admin token**: The Electron main process generates a new admin token on each app start and passes it to the server. The token is sent in the `X-Admin-Token` header for delete operations. If you restart the app, the token changes.
- **Upload safety**: Uploaded filenames are sanitized to their basename (no path components) and a default size limit of 100 MB is enforced (configurable in code).

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **File Type Icons**: Visual representation for different file formats
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished user experience with CSS transitions
- **Custom Scrollbars**: Styled to match the app's aesthetic
- **Gradient Effects**: Modern visual design with glass morphism elements

## 📋 API Endpoints

- `POST /upload` - Upload a file
- `GET /list` - List all uploaded files
   - Returns an array of objects: `{ name: string, size: number }` (`size` in bytes)
- `GET /files/:filename` - Download a specific file
- `DELETE /delete/:filename` - Delete a file (admin token required)
   - Requires header: `X-Admin-Token: <token>`
- `GET /` - Serve the web interface

## ⚙️ Configuration

- The server runs on port 3000 by default. To change this today you need to edit `PORT` in `backend/server.js` and update hardcoded references where applicable.
- Binding host can be configured via environment variable:
   - `LSD_BIND_HOST` (default: `127.0.0.1`)
   - Note: Keeping it on `127.0.0.1` restricts access to the local machine only.
- Admin token is managed automatically by the Electron app:
   - `LSD_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set by the Electron main process per run. You typically do not need to set this manually unless you’re driving the server outside the app.

### Test delete from a browser console or external tools
If you need to verify delete via browser, open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and in the DevTools console run:

```js
const TOKEN = 'paste-the-admin-token-here';
const NAME = 'existing-file.ext';
fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:3000/delete/${encodeURIComponent(NAME)}`, {
   method: 'DELETE',
   headers: { 'X-Admin-Token': TOKEN }
}).then(async r => ({ status: r.status, text: await r.text() }))
   .then(console.log);
```

For testing with **Postman** or **curl**:
```bash
# Replace TOKEN_HERE with your actual admin token
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:3000/delete/filename.ext" \
     -H "X-Admin-Token: TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Note**: The server's CORS configuration specifically allows the `X-Admin-Token` header for browser console testing and external API tools. Since the token is per-session and managed by the app, delete actions should generally be performed via the Electron UI. Manual testing requires the exact token for that run.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

- 403 Forbidden on delete:
   - The admin token likely doesn’t match. Restart the Electron app and try the delete again from within the app UI.
   - If testing manually, ensure you’re sending the correct `X-Admin-Token` for the current session.
- CSS not applying after clone:
   - Run `npm run buildcss` to generate `renderer/css/output.css` (it is not tracked in git).
